# Why React

    - Virtual DOM
    - Reusable (and clearer) Web Component


# Generating react project

To start a react project we need to have node and npm installed on our local machine.

Then react application can be started by adding just React and ReactDOM libraries

The project scaffolding and bare project structure will be available through `create-react-app` tool. 

So we can make utilise that to quickly start our project.
