# Hello World

We know that every program starts with *Hello World!*. 

This is how a **hello world** program looks like in React.

```js
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'


ReactDOM.render(<div> Hello World! </div> , document.getElementById('root') );
```

We need to import react and react-dom libraries.

The program can be run using command

`npm start` it will bring up `Hello World`.
